# Pytest Framework

The problem: At my job we had a custom built Windows 10 application. There was no automation for the application and it was hard to get the application to launch with WinAppDriver.

The solution: Using Python, Winium, Selenium and PyAutoGui I was able to launch the application and find elements to interact with on the UI. I could then successfully write test cases for this application and connect to the SQL Server using PYODBC.
